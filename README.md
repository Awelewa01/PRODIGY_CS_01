# PRODIGY_CS_01
This python program encrypts and decrypts using the Caesar Cipher Algorithm.
It allows users to input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and dcryption.
This python program consists of three functions for encryption, decryption and main functions.
The encryption function computes the encryption using the Caesar Cipher Algorithm with a shift value inputted by the user,
The decryption function computes the decryption using the ecnryption function with a negative shift,
The main function interfaces with the user for interaction with the program.
The program is run on google colab.
In the execution of this program, The message "God is above all!" with shift value of 3 is encrypted as "Jrg lv deryh doo!"
 and decrypted as "God is above all!"
